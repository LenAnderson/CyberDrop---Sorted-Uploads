# CyberDrop - Sorted Uploads
Sort uploads on CyberDrop.me by name


## Installation
You need to have a UserScript extension (e.g. Tampermonkey for Chrome, Greasemonkey for Firefox) installed to run this script.

[Install this UserScript](https://github.com/LenAnderson/CyberDrop-Sorted-Uploads/raw/master/CyberDrop_sorted_uploads.user.js)


For this to work properly you should **set Parallel uploads to 1** in CyberDrop's upload config otherwise you still get some of the files switched around when one of them uploads faster than the other.
